The major problem with DataDao is that you cannot tailor it to meet the demands of off-chain restrictions, because what's the meaning of on-chain data dao if we need to broadcast their off-chain identity first ! That's when it hit me "ZKP" is the ultimate solution to protect the anonymity of data contributors as well as ease of verifiability for DAO operators.

A Data DAO where the dao operator creates the DAO with ZK entry restrictions and multiple contributors can contribute after proving that they are eligible to contribute using ZK-SNARK. After they contribute more than the minimum contributions ( set by the DAO operator ) they will be eligible to get a share of the pool reward after DAO is closed.
